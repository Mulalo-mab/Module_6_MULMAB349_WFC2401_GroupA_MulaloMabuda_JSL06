## CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

### Resource Used:
Google

### Description:
This project implements a menu display system for a restaurant's menu. It allows users to view the menu items categorized into starters, main courses, and desserts. Users can click on any menu item to add it to their order, which is displayed on the side along with the total price. Clicking on an item in the order removes it and deducts the item price from the total.


Users can interact with the menu by clicking on any item they wish to order. When an item is clicked, it is added to the user's order displayed on the side of the menu. Additionally, the total price of the order is updated to reflect the cost of the selected items.

Furthermore, users have the ability to remove items from their order by clicking on them in the order list. When an item is removed, its price is deducted from the total, providing users with flexibility in managing their orders.

Overall, the CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge provides a seamless and intuitive way for users to explore a restaurant's menu, place orders, and manage their selections.
